# SNK vs Capcom Card Fighter Battle Engine

Before I worked on the [SNK vs Capcom Card Fighter Clash Advance](https://github.com/daelsepara/svc_project), I prototyped the card battle in text-graphics detail. I wasn't a game AI expert then, and even now, I still couldn't make the computer give a good game. This was in 2004, a lifetime ago now. After the GBAX 2004 competition, I had hope to release a full version of the game. Sadly, I still haven't gotten back to it. I'm even less inclined to do so now, in 2020. I'm uploading it to GitHub for preservation of my past life as a-would-be-game-programmer-wannabe.
